# Simple GPU Simulator
Please note that this simulator only replicates 1 Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) with grave simplifications and numerous inaccuracies.

However, it is capable of demonstrating threads running in parallel as efficiently as possible while ensuring concurrency.

To execute it in a terminal, use the command `julia run.jl`.

For more explanations, please open the notebook in Pluto.
